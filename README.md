# React exercise projects

- project(s) set up with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for React + TS
- there is 11 exercises, each initialized on its own branch with the name of the branch corresponding to the exercise name
- the project structure is set up so each exercise has its own route, the route(s) can be found in the [routes/AppRoutes file](https://github.com/jspvg/react-exercises/blob/main/src/routes/AppRoutes.tsx) with plans to set up proper navigation on the home page
